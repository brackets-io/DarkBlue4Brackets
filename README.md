# DarkBlue4Brackets

Dark Blue theme is inspired by one of most fascinating themes I've encountered, 
and that is [Bartelme](http://www.bartelme.at)'s Dark Blue theme for WordPress.

His color scheme was so bold and different than others, that I swore to myself 
- one day I'll make a coding theme out of it. (Silly me.) And here it is. 
I hope you'll like it.
